<p>This programme is designed to allow users of all musical knowledge to create their own music and learn exactly how the process of composing music works in order to gain a better understanding of frequency and scales. The music created from this program is done through a javascript coded oscillator, which effectively modifies sine waves. The oscillators require a frequency input which corresponds to a note in a scale. When you pick a key in the main page a random function is carried out which picks a certain number of random notes within that scale and outputs them through your speakers. </p>
